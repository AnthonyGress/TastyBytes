# Motivation:
Have you ever woken up and open your fridge and said to yourself: " I have nothing to eat!" What if its not the lack of ingredients, but rather the lack of recipes you know. Our app Tech Bytes, creates whole recipes that you can make with ingredients you have laying around,along with complete instructions and food labels. Additionally, for my brunch lovers and day drinkers Tech Bytes can create cocktail mixes as well.

# User Story:
As a classy tech hunk who is hard at work 24/7 recipe planning is the last thing on my mind. I want to see recipes based on the ingredients I currently have. After inputting my ingredients, I will be presented with a list of recipes to choose from. Upon selecting a recipe I will be presented with a summary,cooking instructions, and food label. This can also be applied for cocktail making as well. Lastly, if you can not decide on anything we have numerous suggestions to offer; even one to impress your significant other during date night.
